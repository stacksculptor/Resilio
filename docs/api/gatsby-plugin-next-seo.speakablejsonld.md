## SpeakableJsonLd variable

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

The speakable schema.org property identifies sections within an article or webpage that are best suited for audio playback using text-to-speech (TTS).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
SpeakableJsonLd: FC<SpeakableJsonLdProps>
```

## Remarks

Adding markup allows search engines and other applications to identify content to read aloud on Google Assistant-enabled devices using TTS. Webpages with speakable structured data can use the Google Assistant to distribute the content through new channels and reach a wider base of users.

```tsx
const Component = () => <SpeakableJsonLd cssSelector={['#abc', '#root']} />;

```
