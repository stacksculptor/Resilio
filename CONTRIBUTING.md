## Working with gatsby-plugin-next-seo

All of the library code is located in the `src` directory.

The `example` directory contains a fully working GatsbyJS app. This is used in the end to end tests. To run this app first you need to build gatsby-plugin-next-seo from the root directory `yarn build`. You can then run the example gatsby app with

```bash
yarn e2e:build
yarn e2e:start
```

This builds the local gatsby-plugin-next-seo) followed by `yarn e2e:dev`. You can also run it in a production build by running `yarn e2e:build` followed by `yarn e2e:build`.

To run the end to end tests you can run the following command

```bash
yarn test:e2e # builds everything first
yarn test:e2e:quick # Skips the initial build when all you want is to rerun the tests
```

To run the unit tests run `yarn test` or `yarn test:watch` to rerun automatically whenever a file changes.
